**Before reporting an issue**, check whether there are pinned/recent comments on
the AUR and whether your request is really in-line with
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD.

**For more general discussions and questions** about related topics such as
mingw-w64 packaging in general, feel free to open or join a discussion on
https://github.com/Martchus/PKGBUILDs/discussions.

**Note that I cannot help with AUR helpers.** Please report problems with AUR
helpers to their vendors.

**Note that only Arch Linux is supported.** Packages may not build on other
distributions such as Manjaro.
